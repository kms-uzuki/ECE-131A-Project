# ECE 131A Project 19F

Create a random binary symmetric transmission channel, introduce different noise corruptions into the channel, plot the **bit-error rate** relative to the **signal-noise ratio**, and compare the simulated results to a calculated theoretical BER/SNR plot.

When the noise introduced into the channel is Gaussian, we get the following BER/SNR plot:
![Gaussian Noise](images/Gaussian_BER-SNR.png "Gaussian-Noise BER/SNR plot")


When the noise introduced into the channel is Laplacian, we get the following BER/SNR plot:
![Laplacian Noise](images/Laplacian_BER-SNR.png "Laplacian-Noise BER/SNR plot")


Superimposed, we can note the differences in BER/SNR for each channel:
